## üéØ Quick Start: What Can I Do?

Just ask me naturally! Here are real examples:

### ‚ú® Example Conversations

**Add Contractors:**
```
You: "Add a new contractor: 'Bouwbedrijf De Jong' in Rotterdam,
      specializing in kitchens and bathrooms, 4.7 rating, 15 reviews"

Me: I'll create a script to add this contractor to your database!
    [Creates user + contractor, runs script, confirms success]
```

**Add Multiple Items:**
```
You: "Add these 3 renovation templates:
     1. Dakisolatie - ‚Ç¨8000 - 1 week
     2. Vloerverwarming - ‚Ç¨6000 - 3 days
     3. Kozijnen Vervangen - ‚Ç¨12000 - 2 weeks"

Me: I'll create all three templates for you!
    [Creates script, adds all templates, shows results]
```
